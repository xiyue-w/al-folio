abstract = {Making complex structures accessible to blind people is challenging due to the need for skilled explainers. Interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) have been developed to enable independent learning of 3D models through activating audio labels. However, they present single-layered information and require users to identify interactive elements through a pinpointing action, which might be insufficient for learning complex and unfamiliar subjects. In this paper, we investigate I3Ms for complex structures. We propose TouchPilot, a guidance system designed based on a study that observed learner-explainer interaction styles. TouchPilot guides users step by step through navigation, exploration of hierarchical elements, and confirmation of their entire areas. A follow-up study found that the guidance system led to better learning outcomes and higher independence compared to a pinpointing system. Feedback suggests that being primed by the guidance system systematically, followed by pinpointing freely for review, is preferred for learning complex structures.},

abstract = {Obtaining information before a visit is one of the priority needs and challenges for blind museum visitors. We propose BentoMuseum, a layered, stackable, and three-dimensional museum map that makes complex structural information accessible by allowing explorations on a floor and between floors. Touchpoints are embedded to provide audio-tactile interactions that allow a user to learn the museum’s exhibits and navigation when one floor is placed on a touch screen. Using a tour design task, we invited 12 first-time blind visitors to explore the museum building, chose exhibits that attracted them, and built a mental map with exhibit names and directions. The results show that the system is useful in obtaining information that links geometric shapes, contents, and locations to then build a rough mental map. The connected floors and spatial structures motivated users to explore. Moreover, having a rough mental map enhanced orientation and confidence when traveling through the museum.},

abstract = { Although children's behavioral and mental problems are generally diagnosed in clinical settings, the prediction and awareness of children’s mental wellness in daily settings are getting increased attention. Toy blocks are both accessible in most children’s daily lives and provide physicality as a unique non-verbal channel to express their inner world. In this paper, we propose a toy block approach for predicting a range of behavior problems in young children (4-6 years old) measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We defined and classified a set of quantitative play actions from IMU-embedded toy blocks. Play data collected from 78 preschoolers revealed that specific play actions and patterns indicate total problems, internalizing problems, and aggressive behavior in children. The results align with our qualitative observations, and suggest the potential of predicting the clinical behavior problems of children based on short free-play sessions with sensor-embedded toy blocks. },

abstract = {Natural disasters cause long-lasting mental health problems such as PTSD in children. Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children's stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child's playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children's stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children's mental health.},

abstract = {Mutual understanding via sharing and interpreting inner states is socially rewarding. Prior research shows that people find Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) a suitable tool to implicitly communicate their cognitive states. In this paper, we conduct an online survey (N=43) to identify design parameters for systems that implicitly share cognitive states. We achieve this by designing a research probe called "SpotlessMind" to artistically share brain occupancy with another while considering the bystanders' experience to elicit user responses. Our results show that 98 percent would like to see the installation. People would use it as a gesture of openness and as a communication mediator. Abstracting visual, auditory, and somatosensory depictions is a good trade-off between understandability and users' privacy protection. Our work supports designing engaging prototypes that promote empathy, cognitive awareness and convergence between individuals.},

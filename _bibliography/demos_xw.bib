abstract = {A simple way to prototype touch interaction is to extend electrodes from a capacitive touch screen to off-screen areas. With that we aim to develop a toolkit that transforms a user-designed layout into a layout of screen-extension electrodes that realizes touch for rapid prototyping. Nevertheless, this kind of extension cannot detect touch if the physical properties of the electrodes become large. In this work, we decompose the physical design properties of the extension electrode into two factors, the target area, and line bridge, and investigate the limitation of each separately. While revealing some factors, such as area, is extremely limited in term of designing freely, we look into the causes by measuring the capacitive charge on-screen and on-extensions.},

abstract = {Playing with toy blocks reveals patterns in children's play that are valuable for therapy and assessment. Following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed young survivors expressing post-trauma stress in block play. Motivated by the limitations in assessing this behavior using traditional methods, our paper describes the design rationales of AssessBlocks, an action-characterizing system using smartwatch embedded toy blocks. Utilizing a smartwatch's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and capacitive screen, a monitor is able to receive, visualize and document sequential and quantitative play actions that were empirically selected from a preliminary block therapy study on children's post-disaster stress. We also propose our vision of a multi-dimensional behavioral assessment system using actions obtained by AssessBlocks.},
